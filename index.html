<p>I'm Margaret. I'm a Journalism and Mass Communication major from Greenville, SC. 
	After finishing school at Bob Jones University in December I'm starting a new job in Brooklyn, New York. 
	I'll be in charge of  social media for Brooklyn Baptist Church while starting my master's degree in Child Life.</p>
	
<p>While at school I've had many opportunities. I served on Student Leadership Council as the society director, 
	was the assistant director for an opera, wrote for the Collegian, and serve as the Speaker of the House for 
	<a href="http://www.scstudentlegislature.org">South Carolina Student Legislature</a>. 
	Lately, most of my free time has been taken up by my job as an RA on the Freshmen Floor 
	and with my new flower and event business, <a href="http://www.bloom95.com">Bloom 95 Florals</a>.</p>
	
<p> I drink a lot of Quik Trip slushies & Starbucks iced chai lattes, crave chicken pad thai constantly, watch a lot of Food Network, 
	and the ending of Pride and Prejudice still surprises me every time. Some day I'll be a cowgirl. If I don't freeze to death in NYC first.</p>
